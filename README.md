<p>
Welcome to our RSA cryptography project, developed as a part of our final project for the Discrete Mathematics course at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL). In this project, we employed technologies including C for the cryptography implementation and Vue.js with Vuetify for the frontend development.</p>

## What is RSA Cryptography?

RSA cryptography, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm. It plays a crucial role in securing communications over the internet, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring the integrity of digital signatures.

### How RSA Works

RSA encryption relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and their relationship with modular arithmetic. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Choose two large prime numbers, `p` and `q`.
   - Calculate their product `n = p * q`.
   - Compute Euler's totient function, `Ï†(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)`.
   - Choose a public exponent `e` such that `1 < e < Ï†(n)` and `e` is coprime to `Ï†(n)`.
   - Calculate the private exponent `d` such that `d * e â‰¡ 1 (mod Ï†(n))`.

2. **Encryption**:
   - To encrypt a message `M`, the sender uses the recipient's public key `(e, n)`.
   - The sender calculates the ciphertext `C` as `C â‰¡ M^e (mod n)`.

3. **Decryption**:
   - To decrypt the ciphertext `C`, the recipient uses their private key `(d, n)`.
   - The recipient calculates the original message `M` as `M â‰¡ C^d (mod n)`.

The security of RSA cryptography relies on the difficulty of factoring the product `n` (known as the RSA modulus) into its prime factors `p` and `q`. As long as this factorization remains computationally infeasible for sufficiently large numbers, RSA encryption remains secure.

Our project implements the RSA encryption and decryption processes in the C programming language, providing a secure and efficient way to protect your data.
